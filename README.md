* ```eslintrc.json:```This file is used to configure the ESLint code linter, which helps to catch and fix errors and inconsistencies in the JavaScript code.
* ```babelrc:``` This file is used to configure Babel, a tool that transpiles modern JavaScript code into an older syntax that can be understood by older browsers and environments.
* ```env.example:```This file is a template for creating a .env file, which is used to store environment variables for this project. This allows sensitive information such as API keys and database passwords to be kept secure.
* ```sequelizerc:```This file is used to configure Sequelize, an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Node.js, which helps to interact with the database.
* ```houndciignore:```This file is used to exclude files or directories from being analyzed by HoundCI, a code review tool.
* ```hound.yml:```This file is used to configure HoundCI, specifying which tools and configurations should be used during code review.
* ```github:```This folder may contain files related to integrating with Github, such as Github Actions configuration files
* ```Logs:```This folder is used to store log files generated by the application, which can help diagnose errors or other issues.
* ```database:```This folder may contain files related to the database schema or migrations, such as SQL files or migration scripts.
